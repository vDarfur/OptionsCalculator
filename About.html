        Options pricer takes user provided information about an options contract such as the greeks, holding
        period, and anticipated price. Other programs that calculate option prices don't consider implied
        volatility making earnings plays more vague and risky. With options pricer, Vega and Implied volatility
        are both considered so traders aren't blindsided by IV Crush. IV crush is an important factor to
        consider when trading options since even large swings in the right direction can still leave traders at
        a loss. By anticipating changes in implied volatility, Options Pricer makes earnings plays slightly less
        daunting.

            <p1 class="lead">
                As of now, delta is recalculated using gamma only after entire dollar increments. For example, if I
                wanted to calculate the price of a security as the value increased from $1 to $1.50, delta would not 
                be recalculated since the price change was less than a dollar. Additionally, as of now theta is treated
                as a constant (obviously theta is not a constant in practice) so as holding period increases, the calculator
                becomes less accurate. Finally, gamma is treated as a constant as well (working on fixing this) so as the price
                in the underlying security changes, gamma doesn't change at all. I will continue to work on these limitations. If
                there are any other issues or any features you want implemented feel free to contact me @ahmed.darfur@yale.edu
